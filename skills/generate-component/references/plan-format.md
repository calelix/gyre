# Plan Format

This file is read by `generate-component` Step 5–6 to compose and present the Plan that bridges the spec and the discoveries from Step 4. The Plan is presented in a single message; the user approves, amends, or rejects it before any file is written or installed.

---

## Plan structure

The Plan presented to the user has exactly three sections, in this order:

1. **Header line** — states what will be created: the spec's component name, the two output paths (component file and story file), and the spec's `## Where → Decision` value.
2. **Items table** — each row resolves one slot the component generation depends on (see *Items table* below).
3. **Approval prompt** — a closing prompt offering the user the three outcomes described in *Approval mechanism* below.

---

## Items table

Each row in the table resolves one slot. The table has three columns:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `slot` | What the row decides (e.g., "Output directory", "Reference: Button", "Package: next-themes"). |
| `value` | The resolved value, or a `?` placeholder when the source is `user-needed`. |
| `source` | One of eight labels defined below. |

### Source labels

- `spec` — value comes from the spec; the user changing it would be a spec-level change (see *Spec-contradiction termination*).
- `host` — value discovered by reading host files (e.g., the alias-resolved component directory).
- `inferred` — value chosen by the skill from host signals where no single source is authoritative (e.g., the package runner picked from the lockfile, mirroring `setup`'s logic).
- `user-needed` — discovery could not resolve the slot; the user must supply or approve a value before Plan approval can proceed.
- `shadcn-install` — a Reference primitive is not in the host; the `shadcn` skill will be invoked to install it after Plan approval.
- `npm-install` — an external dependency the spec requires is not in `package.json`; the host's package manager will install it after Plan approval.
- `attention` — a non-blocking discrepancy the user should know about (most commonly a spec/`DESIGN.md` token conflict).
- `host-setup-required` — a runtime precondition for an imported symbol is not met in the host (e.g., a context provider missing in the layout tree, an HTML attribute missing, a required config flag absent). Non-blocking — the user can approve the Plan with the precondition unmet (intending to fix the host afterwards). Distinct from `attention`: `attention` covers cosmetic discrepancies that do not affect runtime; `host-setup-required` covers runtime preconditions whose absence changes whether the component behaves as the spec assumes.

## Story-set rendering

The spec's `## How → States` section drives story rows on the Plan. The minimum is one default story (always present). Each non-default named state the spec lists adds a further row — with one exception: states explicitly described as "inherited from" a reference primitive with no component-specific behavior are not made into separate stories; they are exercised through the base primitive's own stories.

In addition, when the spec's `## How → Interactions` or `## Data / Content` section reveals that the component depends on an external context provider (e.g., a ThemeProvider that controls which visual state is visible), the plan includes one story per meaningful provider configuration that produces a visually distinct rendering. These **context stories** are sourced from `inferred`, not `spec`, because they are derived from the implementation requirement, not from a named state in the spec.

Each story row takes the form:

| slot | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| `Story: <state>` | `<StateName>` | `spec` |
| `Story: <context-variant>` | `<ContextVariant>` | `inferred` |

The rows above are templates — the AI substitutes concrete values for the angle-bracket placeholders; this is not literal Plan text. The `value` cell holds the PascalCase named export in `<kebab-name>.stories.tsx` (e.g., `Default`, `Dark`).

The `default` state row uses `slot = "Story: default"`. Named-state rows follow in the order the spec lists them (excluding inherited-only states per the rule above). Context-variant rows follow after, one per distinct provider configuration that produces a visually distinct rendering.

---

## Approval mechanism

The Plan closes with a natural-language prompt. The user responds in their own language; no formal command syntax is required or expected.

Illustrative sentence the AI uses to close the Plan presentation:

> "Approve, amend, or reject this Plan — describe any changes in your own words and I will recompose."

Three outcomes are recognized:

- **Approve as is** — the user confirms the Plan is correct. The skill proceeds to Step 7 (Realize prerequisites).
- **Fill in or amend** — the user resolves a `user-needed` row by supplying the missing value, or amends another row. The skill returns to Step 5 (Compose Plan), recomposes the Plan with the change applied, and re-presents it. This loop continues until the user approves or rejects.
- **Reject** — the user declines the Plan. The skill terminates without writing or installing anything.

### Rows with `host-setup-required`

A Plan that contains one or more `host-setup-required` rows is approvable. The user reads each such row and decides whether to fix the host now (re-running the skill after the fix to refresh the discovery), or to approve as is and fix the host later. The approval prompt does not change shape when these rows are present; the rows themselves carry the information the user needs. When the user approves a Plan with `host-setup-required` rows still unmet, generation proceeds normally — the generated files will typecheck and Storybook-build, but the component may not behave as the spec assumes in the live host until the precondition is supplied.

---

## Spec-contradiction termination

When a user amendment asks for a change that contradicts the spec — for example, renaming a prop that the spec fixes in `## What → Props`, or choosing a `Where` decision the spec did not make — the skill must not silently follow the request.

The skill must:

1. Not apply the change.
2. Tell the user the requested change is a spec-level change.
3. Direct the user to run `clarify-component` to update the spec, and to re-invoke `generate-component` once the spec reflects the change.
4. Terminate the current run without writing or installing anything.

Illustrative sentence the AI should use:

> "That change would alter the spec's `## What → Props` decision. Please update the spec via `clarify-component` and re-invoke `/generate-component` once the spec reflects the change."
